## Overview

**Loraly** is a personal project I built to preserve a person's unique way of writing. By learning from chat messages, the AI captures a loved one's style of conversation—their humor, their advice, their warmth—allowing you to continue chatting with a text-based twin long after they are gone.

By leveraging fine-tuned **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** models on personal chat data, Loraly delivers a high level of personalization and authenticity, moving beyond generic chatbots to create a true digital echo of a human being.

## Key Features

- **Authentic AI Twins:** Create precise digital replicas of any individual's conversational style using their personal chat history.
- **Legacy Preservation:** Offers a meaningful way to preserve the voice and personality of departed loved ones.
- **Style-Consistent Replies:** Generates responses that maintain the unique tone and logic of the original person.
- **Secure & Private:** Implements security measures for sensitive chat data uploads and storage.
- **Intuitive Chat Interface:** Clean, responsive GUI for seamless real-time interaction with AI twins.
