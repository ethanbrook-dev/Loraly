## Overview

**Loraly** preserves a person's unique way of writing. By learning from chat messages, our AI captures a loved one's style of conversation—their humor, their advice, their warmth—allowing you to continue chatting with a text-based twin long after they are gone.

By leveraging fine-tuned **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** models on personal chat data, Loraly delivers an unmatched level of personalization and authenticity, moving beyond generic chatbots to create a true digital echo of a human being.
